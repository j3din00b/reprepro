## Repositories of backup

This repository is simply a complete backup of all Kaisen repositories. It provides backup or relay in case of failure of the initial repository. 

The conf folder will become conf.backup and the conf.orig folder will become conf. 

To make it a backup again, the conf will become conf.orig and the conf.backup will become conf.
