##Prod and backup

The configurations of the production servers (active servers providing packages from https://deb.kaisenlinux.org) are in the conf-prod folder. 

The configurations of the backup servers (they are backups of all Kaisen repositories and take over in case of failure on the main servers) are in the conf-backup folder. 

Each folder contains a README providing information about the functioning of the repositories (pull rules, updates, their roles...).
